"""Improvement"" consists of minor refinements that merely complement the innate condition of a thing. Cope harder, normies."
"""Personality"" is basically deviations from the average human baseline. Some people are funnier than others, some are more outgoing, some are more reserved, these are tiny deviations from the baseline. There's very little actual variety in the ""personality pool"". You'll meet the same archetypes in the playground as you do in High School and later, in the workplace. Very few people are even close to unique and people who are actually unique are in mental institutions.When describing other people, people tend to describe them as: funny, smart, shy, outgoing, kind. These words could be used to describe 8 billion people. Very few words to describe someone's entire being, and that's because personality really doesn't exist, it's not tangible, it's just a set of tendencies. We share 99.999% of our DNA with other humans so of course you're not going to see anything out of the ordinary. We never discover new personality traits in our day to day life. Everything is mapped out already.Your FACE is your personality. Your face is actually tangible and it signal boosts these wave patterns in your ""personality"" and make them actually perceivable. A handsome boy growing up into a handsome man will always be perceived as outgoing and popular and that's what ultimate makes him that. Him just walking around, people will attribute a personality to him and even if he had qualities that were contrary to that image, such as eccentricity in some way, that will be deemed a quirk in the grand scheme of things. Think of Chad Frat Houses, they all have the same personalities. They're not in the fraternity because they have the same personality, it's because they all have the same face. FACE comes first.Your FACE constrains and dictates your personality. You cannot walk around like you own the place if you're a Sub5, you have to fit a certain mold of being a jestermaxxer, a loner or a quiet kid. Confidence is out of bounds.A good personality means = A good face through which some positive tendencies are signalled. The same positive tendencies coming through an ugly face can be perceived as negative.""Just be yourself"" is the worst advice ever as you all know. Your ""self"" is your FACE. If the human race for some reason all looked the same, then these small ""personality"" deviations would matter, but in reality everyone's on completely different starting spots from the get go.In this individualistic society we all like to think of ourselves as so unique. ""Well at least I'm funny"", cope, there's 800 guys who look similar to you and who are just as funny in your small town alone. You're competing with them for the low hanging fruit.Personality = SCAM. FACE = Reigns supreme."

"19 just seems so young and benign now, to me at 31, but yes I suppose most norms are still brainwashed into believing most people that are 19 aren't virgins.... that holds true, for the females only (like 99%). But despite that, at least half of men are virgins at that age, and I'd say that is conservative, because of the insane hypergamy.And yes I do remember not liking it at 19, either. It definitely does get worse."

And reality. A reality that society along with normies refuse to accept and acknowledge
"And to think ugly males keep being gaslighted into just moneymaxxing for ""love"" all so they can be chewed up and spat out in a miserable marriage/divorce."
are you autistic? because you dont look bad at all jfl how are you khhv

"Because their experience isn't the same as ours, simple as.They are starting to open their eyes, a few of them. But not enough yet. Even though normies also get gaslighted and rejected, they still get a better treatment from women that we will ever have, which gives them the false illusion that they're actually good people just like most men. And since hormones often control their peanut-sized little brains, they are easy to get manipulated by the opposite gender.Hearing what you want to hear is always easier than handling the truth. Even truecels aren't able to grasp this fact irl except for a select few like us."

"Enough insane in the membrane incels will have forced the government that only eugenics is good for the world. In turn only the top 10 could exist both men and female anything else is killed to prevent the destruction of the species.  By the time of 2100 the great gender war would have ended and the collapse of civilization had begun. The first generation of bio engineered super humans have walked amongst the earth only programmed to kill things deemed imperfect. The rest of the naturally born humans are separated into group tribes across the globe, to escape the looksmaxxing plague."
"Even after learning about the blackpill and knowing the unfairness of life they still want a fair life .Like nigga what gives you the right to have a fair life when your own birth was unfair.Life is not fair is what makes life exciting in itself we can see the horrors and the happiness.I had a dream last night I imagined a fair world and everything was good now how boring that would be .I crave mass destruction , chaosOh yeah baby I want to burn the world to the ground ."

I don’t. Why would you want to hang out with asshole jocks only for them to have more ways to pick on you. This was the only time in my life i was invited and i just said i ain’t doing it. I don’t trust the normie and i don’t do well when it comes to sports. Don’t be fooled just cuz someone invited you doesn’t mean anything.

I know man. Sucks that this is the reality for so many men
I like some femdom shit but that is just.... weird
"I made a post similar to this but this would be in protecting the oldcels.Oldcels (30+) have been through a lot of shit and they been through way worse than 99.99% youngcels and virgin shaming a 19 year old wouldn't leave much damage because that is still young but making fun of a 30 year old man for being a virgin should be 5+ years of prison time with a 10,000$ fine (minimum too) and the years increase the more years they pass 30 so if you virgin shame a 35 year old thats 10 years of prison and to make an addition to scare normies from doing this, anyone who virgin shames an oldcel will never be legally allowed to be involved in sexual activities for the rest of their life and if they are caught doing any sexual activities that is another 5+ years in prison or whatever years sentence they served and let's add some more spice to this, virgin shaming a oldcel with gray hairs would automatically register as a felony instead of a misdemeanor."

i realized when i have a goatee and some facial hair i look like a sexual offendor fucking brutal. i remember when i used to go outside with the goatee and not a haircut everyone will be staring at me like i am some type of criminal or something
"I retardedly tried to hang myself with a chain, it broke while i was unconscious and my body made a massive thud and neighbours heard that shit and came knocking and no response but i was Fuckin out of it"
I see why you think like that because it’ll happen after you’re gone. Idk if you’ll rope most likely you will. But I am certain the way things are going it can’t be like this for much longer. Something will cause the boiling pot to overflow and when it does it’ll go full nuclear. It won’t happen like my prediction but it’s clear humanity is loving devolution.

"I thought about this. Leading men in Hollywood rarely look like male runway models. Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Gosling, Ben Affleck, Chris Hemsworth, Hugh Jackman are all considered among the most handsome men in Hollywood, but they look nothing like the guys at Paris fashion week.My theory:1. People want to see faces with more ""character"" in the movies. Male models are often just blank slate, avatar, alien looking.2. People want the characters to look believable and like someone they know. A male model with hollow cheeks and sharp cheekbones is not something you see IRL really, but more rugged features are more common."

"I want to talk today about inkwells, but I don't want to exclusively talk about inkwells from the traditional perspective. Rather, I want to talk about inkwells from a perspective that stems from the basis of human psychology, in the sense that why is it that people don't get them? Why is it that people can't stand them? The phenomenon we observe when it comes to the misunderstanding of inkwells is not that different from the misunderstanding we can observe when it comes to other phenomena between human beings.Now, if you've been with me for a while, then you almost certainly know that I've talked a lot about this phenomenon that I dub the problem of self-extrapolation. We struggle a great deal as human beings to understand the problems and dilemmas of other people, as individuals or as groups, because we are fundamentally separated from each other. Our consciousness is obviously separated from the consciousness of others, but on top of that, there's a serious issue of an inability to imagine what it's like to be that other person. Everything we look at, invariably, especially when you're not trained to do differently, looks like something you're either familiar with or you're not. People know what they know, people are familiar with what they know, what they experience, and generally speaking, things that are outside of that box become very, very difficult to understand.As far as motivation is concerned when it comes to this understanding, that's another factor to consider. When you do not have a certain problem, you are rarely, as I've said many times, motivated to understand that problem, whatever it might be. If you're not diabetic, say a diabetic type 1, a congenital diabetic, then as an average person, you're probably not going to be super motivated to understand the interaction of insulin and blood sugar levels and things of this nature. You're just going to go about your day and do what you do. People are concerned, and this is really important to understand, about things that affect them.The combination of the inability to extrapolate beyond oneself, which is, I would argue, the source of virtually all human misunderstanding at the social and psychological level, as well as the very normal reality to be concerned with things that affect you but not to be concerned with things that don't affect you, is important. This also goes back to the point I made in that Asmongold video, by the way, that out of sight, out of mind is a real thing. It's part of the reason why people don't care. It doesn't affect you directly, so you don't care.How does this relate to inkwells? It's actually a good question. For the most part, the misunderstanding, the reproach, and indeed the derision that a lot of inkwells experience, however they might be presenting themselves, because there's no uniformity necessarily in how they present themselves, is related to these issues I just touched upon: inability to extrapolate beyond oneself and the out of sight, out of mind phenomenon. People are just not affected by these problems.Now, I'm basing this, of course, on the argument that inkwells would make that they're basically sub-fives or even sub-fours, that they're extremely unattractive men. There are people who contest this, obviously, and the little official research that's been done has not confirmed this. In fact, they haven't touched upon the looks factor at all, probably because it's very difficult to test. But I will take the inkwells at their word and say that it is a problem with their looks. Even if it's not universally so, it probably is the case in a large majority of cases. As many people have pointed out, if you're an average-looking person, a quote-unquote normie, to use the looks definition of that, then you typically have a fair bit of room in terms of looks-maxing, in terms of optimizing your appearance. There are obviously severe limitations. You could be really good-looking but only 5'4"". It's a thing that exists. But let's say you're of average height, let's say you're 5'10"", and you are a 5.5. There are things you could do. Do you have unlimited room? No.But this isn't just about acquiring mates or dates because, as almost all of you know by now, there's this thing called the halo effect. When you're a sub-five or perhaps even worse, a sub-four, especially as a male, then the world looks very different, and more importantly, the world looks at you very differently. How people receive you and perceive you is fundamentally different than what you can imagine as an average-looking guy. It's true you're invisible; nobody pays attention to you. But they're also probably not going to recoil away from you when you order a coffee or apply for a job. You're just going to be another faceless guy who looks like anybody else. You're not going to scare people off or scare people away. I'm not even talking about women here; I'm just talking about people.When you're sub-four, and I've talked to a few of these people on occasion, the world is completely different. You are sometimes just invisible, but even worse, you're sometimes very apparent. I.E. your existence is apparent, I.E. people will look at you, make fun of you, they will feel repulsed by you. When you're truly unattractive, let's use the word ugly as a man specifically, the reception you receive from the world is something you just don't understand as an average-looking man or person. It's just not something you're going to get.This is where the lack of creativity, the problem of self-extrapolation, the out of sight, out of mind, stuck-in-your-own-head principle comes into play. If you're an average-looking person, none of these issues are going to affect you. Now, it's still even more different if you're truly attractive. Then you're not invisible anymore, at least to some degree. People, especially women, are going to pay attention to you. The reception is the opposite effect, basically the halo effect versus the phthalo effect.Have you ever witnessed the incredulity, the state of disbelief, of average-looking people or, more importantly, attractive people towards the average inkwell, a sub-four or a sub-five? It's pretty astonishing because these people are stuck in their heads, as we all are to some degree, and cannot extricate themselves from their own experience. They really think in many cases, and this is maybe a hot take, that all you need to do is take a shower, or all you need to do is change your attire, or all you need to do is come off more friendly. I don't think in most cases this is malice or intentional cynicism. Remember, people in general are not incredibly bright, and people in general almost to a fault are stuck in their own heads and stuck with their own experiences. When they approach other people, when they're looking at other people's experiences, it's always from their perspective.You know my problems, if you've been with me for a while, with sleep. I'm a chronic insomniac. It's killing me slowly; it's been that way for decades. Everyone is going to give me advice, probably in the comment section again, ""This worked for me, you need to do this."" I could tell you I've probably done it already, but that won't help. They'll say, ""You've done it wrong."" This is this problem of self-extrapolation, but I don't think it comes from a position of malice.You might be aware, but Reab Room made a video about a week plus ago, reanalyzing an interview with some actual models, including Sean O'Pry. I'd have to disagree with Rehab Room a little bit on the idea that Sean O'Pry is really aware of what he's saying and what he's thinking. If you're Sean O'Pry, a supermodel, an 8.5 or whatever, that is what your life has been. You don't know anything different, so why would you be aware of other people's experiences? I generally agree with much of what Rehab Room has to say, but I really think that people are stuck in their own heads, and so Sean O'Pry, just as a random example, is no different. He's a super attractive supermodel, and that's about it. He doesn't have a lot of room in terms of his capacity of thought, his ability to look at other people's situations. He's only used to easy mode in his case.Now, there is an asymmetry here because if you're a sub-five or a sub-four, a proper inkwell, then you are accustomed to difficult mode. But for a variety of reasons, you're more in a position to observe that other people not stuck in your category are treated differently from you. Why? Because being in that category as an inkwell is actually a problem, a challenge, a difficulty you face. When you face a difficulty, you're more inclined to think about how to tackle it, if at all possible. Obviously, you're going to think about the things you can do, just as I have over the years with sleep. Nothing's really helped, but that's beside the point. You're going to think about the things that you face, the problems. How might I solve them? You're going to spend a lot of time with it. You're going to analyze it, and more importantly, you're going to be in a position to look at other people not in your category and see how it is different from your situation because it's an actual problem, because it's a challenge, because it makes your life worse.That's the key feature here. The reason why Chads or even top-tier normies, as many people might use the term, are totally oblivious to, say, the plight of the inkwell is because in their situation it renounces their benefit. It's not a challenge; it makes their life easier. Hardship produces either failure, an attempt to counter that hardship, or in the best of cases, the successful surmounting of that hardship and everything in between. Obviously, these are not discrete categories, which is why people spend enormous amounts of time looking at their own problems. Inkwells are just as much stuck in their own heads as other people. It's not like they have a superpower. It's just their particular circumstance forces them to think about what it might be like for other people because it's a problem for them. When it's not a problem, you look really good, you don't think about it. It's that simple.But it is possible, at least in theory, with some individuals, I think I've done a decent job of it, to extrapolate beyond your own experience and understand something, at least on an intellectual level. Example: I absolutely despise alcohol. I've never liked it. I think I've tried it three or four times in my life, and I'm pushing 50. I hate it. There's no version of myself in this universe that's ever going to become an alcoholic. I have tons of other problems, but alcoholism won't be one of them. And yet, I know people and have had close friends who struggle with alcohol, who come from families of alcoholics, basically addicts in this case, drug addicts. I'm still able to understand why that's so much of a challenge to them.Sometimes you can draw analogies with yourself. For example, I struggle, as many people do, this is hardly me saying I'm unique in this regard, with sweets, right? I have to actively fight the urge to consume sweets, pastries, all these things. I'm a bit of a sugar addict. Many people are. Seeing from that perspective, the idea that somebody else might be addicted to a substance such as alcohol is not that alien. It's not that strange at all. But people rarely do the legwork in order to achieve that understanding, and here's the thing, they don't want to. In the case of inkwells, there's an added layer here. In the case of inkwells, they don't want to. People, average people specifically, and of course the most attractive people, do not want to understand the plight and challenges of inkwells. Why? Basically because of the phthalo effect. The very thing that the inkwells are complaining about, the very thing they're suffering from, their extremely poor physical appearance, makes them targets of apathy, derision, scorn, and in some cases even hatred. That's basically the phthalo effect. These other people want them to shut up about their problems because they don't think they're real, because they can't extrapolate beyond their own experience, and because they find them repulsive. So, all the more reason to say, ""Shoo, go away. Don't talk about this. Don't talk about this.""Now, it is possible, as I said, to extrapolate beyond your own experience to understand at least intellectually how something else might be. People have done this. Serpinator, the Punani Slayer that you're familiar with, the guy is 6'4"", but intellectually he can certainly understand that if you're 5'4"" as a guy, or even 5'8"" or 5'10"", you are in a different category, and you will be treated differently. He can't viscerally experience that or explain it or replicate it in his own life, but he can understand this is how the world works. If you're in this category, you'll be treated accordingly, as opposed to this other category. It is entirely possible to do that, given the requisite motivation, given the requisite cognitive ability. However, in most cases, that is lacking. Even when people are really smart, there's just no motivation.I'll give you one final example before I part ways. Some moons ago, I was in this conversation with, unironically, a mathematics professor at a prestigious university in California. This guy's intellect, cognition, is off the charts. I'm not especially bright; I am basically mentally compared to this guy. We got into this conversation about the problem of homelessness and drug addiction and alcoholism and how there are all these people there running around, setting up their tents, and lost in life. Then we specifically got to this idea of unemployment. A lot of them are unemployed, they got fired. He said to me, and I thought this was bizarre, ""If I were them, I would start studying things such as, unironically, IT, programming, coding, so I could get my life together and find a job. And if I ever became homeless, I would gather my resources and that's what I would do."" This is a guy with an IQ that's probably approaching 150, and since then has quit that job and works for a private company making close to $2 million a year as some kind of mathematical data analyst.Do you see the problem here? ""If I were them."" But you're not them. You couldn't grasp, this hyper-intelligent guy, that there are people out there that don't have his brain capacity, that there are people out there that are lost in cycles of drug addiction and mental illness and alcoholism. Me, the intellectual dwarf compared to that guy, understands that. So, it's partly a cognitive issue, but it's also not. This guy couldn't get it, wouldn't get it. He was basically, in some sense in that moment, a complete idiot because he could not extrapolate beyond his own experience. That applies to the intellect, and it certainly applies to looks. As I've said, it applies across the board. Most people are not going to show you an inkling of understanding if they do not share your experience directly. It's a special person that can go beyond themselves to delve into the problems and dilemmas of other people in order to understand them, even if they're not affected by it.Anyway, as always, thank you for tuning in.

I was 14-15. I got panic attacks and started skipping school because i couldn't handle the mog.

Im missing out on not being called retarded and slow and making people get frustrated and struggling to get the most incel job to date
"Im retarded as fuck. I seen some spergs who were incredibly smart and some were liked just because of it but me? fuck no i was born with the stupid kind of autism. I sucked ass at math and whats worst is that the most incel job is computer science so idk what to fucking do.Im so fucking slow and i always mess up shit and make multiple mistakes. I was even called slow before. I cant remember everything someone says too. Its really over when ur not even intelligent and cant even remember simple instructions. all i know is stupid ass games. People would even say ""this guy doesnt know what he is talking about"""

"im slow but i can talk for hours about the evolution of military uniforms, this aint useful ofcourse"
"I'm so tired of hearing from normies that the blackpill is some shocking revelation based on little to no evidence. If you've had any experience with foids or have tried asking women in the past out, then all of this should just be considered common fucking sense. How do you go your whole life being so delusional that you don't understand how women actually operate? Do they just put on their blinders and lie to themselves because this isn't the reality that they actually wanted? I don't know how anybody can cope with this shit life anymore. And I fucking hate when normies tell me to be 'grateful' for being here, when I never wanted to be here in the first place."

Now that he doesn’t have to do that, he has lots of extra cash and has been buying lots of pinball machines which is his hobby. She never let him out one in the living room, but a week after she died, he bought another one and put it right in the living room"
It was the same for me it was so bad and made me cry
"It will be a global jungle and on,y the bad will get rewarded. Erenyeager has decided to move from this universe to next in the foreseeable future abandoning the stubborn species that was once called its people"
It’s also refreshing to not financially have to provide for a woman
"It’s still needlessly cruel. If I were@Deep.NestI would never accept something this in your face. I can understand foids not being into me to a certain degree. I can accept being a freak if it means people leave me alone and let me rot without constantly agitating me for their own amusement like his brother is doing to him.That is incredibly cruel behavior. It’s like showing off your dance moves next to a paraplegic dancer or showing off your football tricks next to a wheelchair football player, just to be smug about what they can’t have.It’s fucked up and to accept that is incredibly humiliating to me. I would gladly pummel that stupid sorry motherfucker in Deep.Nests name if I could."

"My older brother was always a dick to me growing up and is in part why I have such low self esteem, but another reason I've grown to resent him is because he is superior to me in nearly every way.He is taller than me (5'11), he has a more attractive face, he has better hair, and on top of that, he has no problem socializing and flirting with women. He has hooked up with numerous girls in the past, all of whom were attractive, thin, and white, and has had a girlfriend before who really loved him (also attractive, thin, and white). Despite him being ND like me, he has no issues making close friends and flirting with women. He struggled with it when he was a very young kid, but that seems to have gone away. People take him seriously and many people have respect for him, something which I've never really experienced at any point in my life.When we were both young, we actually had the same IQ of 119, but recently we had testing done and his IQ increased a few points and minedecreaseda few points. He went to a higher ranked college than me and graduated with good grades while I dropped out of my university and am now stuck in community college. He was never bullied in high school either, a little bit when he was in elementary school but again that didn't last long. He didn't go to his senior prom due to it being canceled by COVID, but he actually had a very hot date he was planning to go with. So when he asks girls out, there is actually a possibility he might succeed (which it has numerous times) but when I ask a girl out, she always either rejects me, gets very clearly uncomfortable, or sometimes downright laughs at me.Every time I see him, he is a brutal reminder of how pathetic and subhuman I am. He's even rubbed the fact that I'm an incel in my face before because he enjoys it when others feel inferior to him. I'm quite a bit of a cunt now, but for most of my life I've been a much better person than him. All of my relatives and my parents' friends knew and would privately comment on how I was always much kinder and more well behaved than he was, yet HE is the one who gets to experience life's greatest luxuries and actually has the potential for a decent future while I rot alone every single day of my life.I remember one time he had his girlfriend over and they were snuggled up on the couch and started making out right in front of me. Later in the middle of the night, I was walking to the kitchen and I passed by his room and I heard them both giggling so I thought they were probably having sex.The next day after she left,my brother confirmed my hunch when hetoldme that the two of themstayed up all nightFUCKING EACH OTHER!!THE STUPID BASTARD STRAIGHT UP TOLD ME!!!I can't fucking do this anymore"

That's why this site makes high inhib because it increases the memory of being an incel in your head
"The concept of ""improvement"" is one of the saddest things in the world, it is proof that life comes in different levels of difficulty."
The fact that this normgroid has asked you whether you've ever had a girlfriend and sex before is a HUGE RED FLAG. The fag already knew that you were an incel and just wanted to mock you. He wouldn't bother asking you such questions  if you were a neurotypical normie like him
the feminist in question
"The most brutal realization is that chad never had to improve himself, he just had to exist. He didn’t have to improve in any way, physically or mentally. He could’ve been a mentally ill schizo who is in and out of psych wards his whole life and he’d still drown in pussy. He never had to step foot in a gym, he could even be overweight and he’d still probably easily get girlfriends. The brutal reality is that I’m not good enough for women and never was. They watch me running to and fro trying to improve myself and they laugh at me with amusement and pity, knowing there is literally nothing I can do to make them attracted to me. They never were and they never will be"

There is a post from today about a literal homeless chad with foids willingly asking to give him a home and food.
there’s  2 people i gotta work with and one of them is ur typical normie jock who likes basketball and talks about how he approaches foids all day and etc. I can’t fit in with people like this  it’s all neurotypical  talk and the guy asked me if i ever had a girlfriend and had sex with a foid before and i just lied and said yes and then he asked if i spoke to any girls and i told him i didn’t at the moment due to college.He also invited me to hang out to play basketball but i said nah i don’t really do sports. I also lied about the games i played i just told them i play halo and some other grown up games although they said they play minecraft.I also said i peaked in elementary and they said  im not peaking currently although they’re nice. the other guy is some chad who said he never had a girlfriend before but the other guy said he was lying. I hope i don’t gotta work with them again although they’re nice

"Unfairness begets losers. And since you're here, you're probably a victim to some extent yourself (unless you're larping in which case gtfo). Obviously we still got it good compared to some very unfortunate kids in Africa (child labor etc.) but still. My point is that by championing unfairness, you're embracing the very thing that made you draw the (comparatively) short straw."
unprivate your profile so I can break your hymen
"Very few male models can act decently, and most audiences honestly prefer ordinary looking chads to gay aliens"
"very relatableAh, finally a reasonable userImagine watching guys in tight clothing or shorts run around after a ball & tackle one another"
"very well said, i wish i could explain my meaning as concisely and effectively"

"Virgin shaming a bald guy is even worse and should carry the death penalty(get on finasteride while you still can, baldingcels)"
Wanting a fair life isn't naive. Expecting one is though.
"Was talking with one of my co-workers and I enjoy talking to him... but some of his takes are absurd even for me. First off, he genuinely believes agartha is real place, he believes Dinosaurs never existed, he believes that Spirits are constantly watching him and he even told me that you quite literally just need to believe in something for it to happen. For example, he told me he believed that a poor man could become a millionaire in a month simply by trying and believing in himself. Among the funniest things he told me was that blackpill is bullshit and when I inquired about his relationship status, he told me that he was abstaining for marriage and that he's a traditionalist catholic ( I don't know how to tell him that trad women don't exist)"
Wdym
Wdym?
We all are brother. Little by little it is getting harder to cope.
We are too defective for this world.
We pray he can survive without the forum for a month lol
'we wuz kangz'
Well you're right. Outside of these though there's nothing.
What about fags?
what am i gonna tell them if i do have brain damage? that i hanged myself? i dont want to go to a gay ass psych ward with ramona flowers type crazy bitches
"What happened to nofap, yo"
what’? i don’t live with them
What’s happening to him is literally something straight out of the darkest sulfuric pits of internet porn addict’s cuck folder. Like imagine your own brother boasting to you that he’s been fucking with some white 19 yo college girl the whole night. Suifuel so potent you can feel your jugular vein opening on its own.

What'd he do? I honestly don't remember him
What's fair and unfair is merely a concept. Placing value in unfairness is the same as placing it in fairness itself. No one can accurately measure what a fair life would be like because life isn't ruled by principles that govern themselves. What is unfair for you is fair for someone else.
Whats ur avi from ?
Where could he possibly go.
Wherever he pleases
Which is their own doing. I erenyeager am right
which one of u fags is larping as this guy?
Who was that? The bufallo shooting?
Why are you so obsessed with IT?
why are you trying so hard to be edgy its cringe af
why is that retard not banned then
"why is u/Kairoxnova claiming to be a Chad, when he is obviously no such thing?"
Why u hate me
Whyare they lying to you like a retard fuck that
without a doubt
WMake normies seethe more brocel
Worst part is he really thinks he is a decent moral person. He's pretty intelligent but his self awareness is lacking

wow
wtf are u talking about GrAY
Ye I shaved yesterday I think
"yea but even I got a pussy and shoved it in my avi, it doesn't matterbut chad life peaks with teen love, and after that it is worthlessthere is no life after teen love, just the futile and sisyphean attempt to relive it, which is ultimately pontless"
"yea no shit it's normal to want justicebut idc personally injustice is fine with me as long as foids suffersouthport was the death of random 'innocent' foids, so idk if everyone considers it fair but I consider it based"
Yeah and being a good companion to a girl and no kids
yeah but i feel like if i speak to them more eventually they’ll pick on me. i’m still working at the moment and just stopped speaking to them so much
"Yeah genetics are pretty weird. Both my parents are midgets and I clearly took after them, but for some reason he came out superior"

"yeah i got the tism but am clicnically retardedGeckobus IQ Reveal - I got diagnosed with Aspergers Today and my IQ is 90 (80 functional)Just came back from final diagnosis appointment. Got diagnosed with Aspergers and an IQ of 90, practical IQ of 80. I will attach pics to prove it. So much for the retards calling people like me defeatist. I am just realistic when I say I am clinically retarded.  Let's start with this one. It...incels.is"
yeah i know he was trying to probably see what i was gonna say. It’s such a weird question to even ask your coworker. Who tf is so comfortable to ask if you had sex with a girl like bro what. And he nonstops talks about approaching girls and saying how he wouldn’t cheat on his girl and how some girls reject him and he doesn’t care. the guy has the mentality of a high schooler.His voice sounds like he is going through puberty and he is shortLying about what. if ur talking about the normie yeah he probably was lying about getting girls since he isn’t chad
"Yeah, it fucking sucks. Nothing we can do about it though"
Yep
Yep
Yep
Yep
Yep and the cycle never ended
"Yep. All he has done is make my life worse. On the very rare occasions as a kid when we were actually having a pleasant time together, out of the blue he'd mention how short and tiny I was just to be a dick. He doesn't do this as much now but his asshole side still makes quite a few appearances"

"Yep. And little by little it’s harder to even jack off. It takes a way harder grip to feel anything now than it did 3 years ago. It’s like “death grip syndrome”. I still jack off 4 times a day because it’s one of my best copes. Even though my physical libido is burnt out, it’s hard to mentally go without it long enough for my system to reset."
yep. this exactly. to be honest though for a traditional catholic i would expect this. they essentially believe shit falls into their life slowly but surely as long as you do the right thing. that explains tyrone fucking the pastors daughter
Yes I will. And our interaction is one of the reason I really have to. Even fellow incels are so spitefull to each other for no reason
"Yes, even for youngercels like me at age 19. I have to keep the fact I’m a virgin secret from everyone except my family or I’d be ostracized even more than I already am. Even my own family virgin shames me"
"You can probably fuck him up in some way that isn’t illegal. Nobody is telling you to kill him, dude, wtf.Just fuck around and make his life miserable. Take bites out of his food, leave fart gas in his bedroom where he’s fucking the foids, cut tires in his car so he turns up late for work, email his workplace with fake racist social media postsanything is good as payback for what that fucker did to you."
